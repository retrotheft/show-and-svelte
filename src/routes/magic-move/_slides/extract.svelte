<h1 id="subtitle">Extract</h1>

<template>
   <p>What if I were to pass a list of 'slides' into a 'Stage' component, and then somehow extract the snippet's contents and manipulate them?</p>
   <p>Specifically, I would need to read the IDs of elements, and insert them into persistent containers on the Stage that actually performed the transitions.</p>
