# Show & Svelte

Create fully interactive presentations with Svelte.

- all transitions are automatic. Just place elements on slides.
- comes with `code-input` and `markdown-it` included for convenience
- syntax highlighting, just BYO `highlight.js` and configure it
- autotype fx included, more on the way!

As of version 0.0.2, Show & Svelte is in public alpha and should be usable.

Full README and instructions to follow shortly. For now you can refer to the demo project in routes.
